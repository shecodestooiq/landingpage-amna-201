            <summary>Story</summary>
            <p>The story for Last Night at the Telegraph Club was first published by Malinda Lo in an anthology as a short story, named "New Year". Lo came up with the idea for it when she heard about the lesbian bars that operated in North Beach, near San Francisco's Chinatown.[1]

                She spent three years writing the book.[2] During her research for the book, Lo visited the GLBT Historical Society. The author also drew from her own experience going to lesbian bars to write some of the scenes.[1]
                
                Lo's book was influenced by Sarah Waters' Tipping the Velvet and Patricia Highsmith's The Price of Salt. She was also inspired by Kevin Kwan's Crazy Rich Asians when deciding to use footnotes for occasions where Chinese words appear.[1] Lo also mentions Rise of the Rocket Girls, by Nathalia Holt, and Wide-Open Town: A History of Queer San Francisco to 1965, by Nan Alamilla Boyd, as two books she was reading when writing the original short story, which influenced her writing.[2] The title was inspired by the novel Last Night at the Blue Angel: A Novel by Rebecca Rotert.
                
                Publication history
                The rights to the publication of Last Night at the Telegraph Club in North America were acquired by Dutton Books for Young Readers' editor Andrew Karre in early 2017, through Lo's agent Michael Bourret. The book was initially scheduled to be released in 2019.[3] In June 2020, Penguin Random House began advertising the release of the book, which was moved to January 19, 2021.[4][5]
                
                Companion book
                In September 2021, Publishers Weekly reported the rights for a companion book had been acquired by Andrew Karre, to be published in 2022. Called A Scatter of Light, it tells the story of Aria Tang West, who is connected to the two main characters from Last Night at the Telegraph Club.[6] Lo began writing A Scatter of Light in 2013, but only received an offer for the story in 2017, after Karre offered to buy the rights for it and Last Night at the Telegraph Club. According to the author, they agreed to first publish Last Night at the Telegraph Club in response to the "nightmare of the Trump administration". After returning to it, Lo created a connection between the two stories.
                
                The book was released on October 4, 2022.

                During autumn 1790, Blake moved to Lambeth, Surrey. He had a studio at the new house that he used while writing what were later called his "Lambeth Books", which included The Book of Los in 1795. Like the others under the title, all aspects of the work, including the composition of the designs, the printing of them, the colouring of them, and the selling of them, happened at his home.[4] The Book of Los was one of the few works that Blake describes as "illuminated printing", one of his colour printed works with the coloured ink being placed on the copperplate before being printed.[5]

Both The Book of Los and The Book of Ahania were the same size, produced at the same time, and were probably etched on opposing sides of the same copper-plates. Both works were the only ones by Blake to have intaglio etchings instead of relief etchings.[6] Likewise, both works were colour-printed, where the various coloured inks were directly applied to the etching instead of added in later

            <summary>Story</summary>
            <p>
                In a world ruled by sin, love is a dangerous game.

Eva has never fit into the restrictive Commonwealth, where love is a sin and lust is a death sentence. But when she’s chosen to become an assassin, she doesn’t just belong…she shines. Eager to find her place at last, Eva’s determined to use her eerie abilities to best her deadly, not to mention handsome, mentor, Ari. But she soon realizes that besting your mentor is difficult when you’re falling for him.

Bound together by a blood oath, there’s no way for Eva to avoid Ari. Yet the more time they spend together, the harder it is to resist the lure of his green eyes, his grace with a sword, and the charm beneath the sarcastic front he shows the world. When Ari falls for Eva too, they are terrified. As their feelings grow, and Eva’s mysterious physical gifts heighten, so does the threat of discovery. But the Commonwealth is built on secrets, and when Ari uncovers one that could destroy it, Eva must choose between love and survival.

Author's Note If you can’t resist fierce girls with swords, infuriating guys with hearts of gold, forbidden love between a mentor and apprentice who can’t keep their hands off each other, and star-crossed lovers who fight to the death by each other’s sides, then this is the book for you.
